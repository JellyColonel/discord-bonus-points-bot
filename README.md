## Help Command Features

The `/help` command provides:
- **Organized command list** - Commands grouped by category (Activities, Balance, Settings)
- **Clear descriptions** - Each command explained in Russian
- **Admin-aware** - Shows admin commands only to users with admin permissions
- **Additional info** - Explains VIP bonuses, events, and daily reset time
- **Always accessible** - Footer reminder on most commands

## Database

Creates `bonus_points.db` with three tables:
- `users` - User VIP status and BP balance
- `activities` - Daily activity completions
- `settings` - Bot configuration (including event status)

## Event Mode

Admins can enable x2 BP events using `/toggleevent true`:
- Shows üéâ indicators in all responses
- Changes embed colors to gold
- Automatically calculates doubled BP for all activities
- Applies multiplier on top of VIP bonuses (VIP + Event = 4x base BP)
- Event status persists in database (survives bot restarts)

To disable: `/toggleevent false`

## Admin Setup

To use the `/toggleevent` command, either:
1. Set `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` in `.env` to your Discord admin role ID, OR
2. Have the "Administrator" permission in Discord

If `ADMIN_ROLE_ID` is not configured, only users with Administrator permission can toggle events.

## Tips

üí° **Use autocomplete** - When typing `/complete` or `/uncomplete`, start typing the activity name and Discord will show suggestions

üí° **Check help anytime** - Type `/help` to see all available commands

üí° **Track your progress** - Use `/total` daily to see how many BP you earned

üí° **Set realistic goals** - Use `/activities` to see which activities you've completed
